3/30/2018 :First project contribution: Our group decided to create 4 branches for 4 different parts(Android, Controller, Back end, Non-Android). Since we are still on the research phase this week, we think for now it's better to leave our branches that way without merging it to the master. 

Team Members and Roles:

	Changze Han (hawkid 'changzhan') -- Android Front End Specialist
	Maison Holzer (hawkid 'mholzr') -- Controller/Networking Specialist
	Trevor Lowry (hawkid 'tnlowry') -- Back End Specialist
	Blake Irons (hawkid 'birons') -- Non-Android Front End Specialist
