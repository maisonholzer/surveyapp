Outline for my part:

  1. Collect data from view, whether it be a username/password or survey answer.
  2. Check to see if an error should be thrown; i.e., if a u/p is not correct, give an error message, or if a survey 
     question asks for a number and user gives alphanumeric, give error message.
  3. If data passes error test, give data to back-end to collect.
  4. If back-end has data to be given back to user, collect and give to view to let user know what happened.


Research completed: 

  1. Learn more about converting JSON and searching for a good program already written to do this.
  2. Begin to understand how exactly to give info to back-end (i.e., convert username/password requests to be put in csv file
     to be easily checked by back-end.
  3. Start working in IntelliJ with net demo example.
